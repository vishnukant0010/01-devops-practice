MINES Game 🎮💣

A simple Mines game built using Java and Java Swing.
This project is designed as a Core Java + DSA + Problem-Solving practice project.

📌 Game Rules

Game board me 25 columns (cells) hote hain.

Start karne se pehle aapko select karna hota hai kitni mines chahiye.

Aap ek-ek chance me ek cell select karte ho.

Agar safe cell nikla → game continue hoga.

Goal: Mines se bach kar maximum safe cells discover karna.
